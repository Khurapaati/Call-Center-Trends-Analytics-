## Project Insights
* Call Volume by Day:
The graph shows that the number of calls varies throughout the month, with peaks on weekdays and a decrease on weekends. This suggests that call volume is driven by business hours and customer activity levels.

* Agent Performance:
The table shows that there are five agents with varying performance metrics. Jim has the highest number of calls and resolved queries, while Becky has the highest overall rating. This suggests that there may be opportunities to improve the performance of some agents.

* Answer Rate and Resolution Rate:
While the answer rate of 81% is within the industry average, there is still room for improvement. The resolution rate of 73% is lower than the industry average, suggesting that some calls are not being fully resolved on the first contact.

* Call Handling:
The average call response time of 67.52 seconds is slightly higher than the industry average of 60 seconds. This could be due to a number of factors, such as understaffing, lack of training, or complex customer inquiries.
The average call duration of 3.75 minutes is also higher than the industry average of 3 minutes. This could be due to the same factors as the longer response time, as well as a high number of complex calls.

* Customer Satisfaction:
The average customer satisfaction rating of 3.40 is slightly below the industry average of 3.5. This suggests that some customers are not satisfied with their experience with the call center.


## Conclusion
The call center needs to hire more agents or find ways to improve efficiency in order to handle the increased call volume. The call center also needs to provide better training and support to its agents in order to improve their ability to resolve calls quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the call center should investigate ways to improve agent satisfaction, such as providing more breaks, offering more opportunities for professional development, and recognizing agent achievements.

## Suggestions
Hire more agents or implement a call deflection strategy, such as a chatbot or self-service portal, to reduce the number of calls that reach agents.
